## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with \`+\`, \`-\`, or \`*\`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as \`1.\`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

**Hey! Thanks for trying this out!**

All I can say is this is a __100__ **LIT** [Markdown API](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) and

it is indeed wonderful how something like this exists.

~~Atleast for me~~

This Markdown Previewer is **One** out of **Five** Projects that I have made in the past, and the others would be:

1. React Hook Calculator [^First]
2. React Hook Pomodoro Clock [^Second]
3. React Hook Drum Pad  [^Third]
4. React Hook Random Quote Machine [^Fourth]

[^First]: React Hook Calculator github link [here](https://github.com/Darealtube/React-Calculator)
[^Second]: React Hook Pomodoro Clock github link [here](https://github.com/Darealtube/react-pomodoro)
[^Third]: React Hook Drum Pad github link [here](https://github.com/Darealtube/React-drumpad)
[^Fourth]: React Hook Random Quote Machine github link [here](https://github.com/Darealtube/react-QuoteMachine)

I learned React with the help of **[Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**, and I am very thankful.

You may notice that all of them have ==Hook== in them, that's because I really don't like using Class Components
anymore. Plus, I just love ==Functional Programming== and React Hooks make use of Functional Components, so it is just

_**WONDERFUL**_.

At the time of Writing, this is the last project out of the Five, and I will make my ==Personal Portfolio== page next, which I
will publicly release as a website, along with the other websites that I made.

And when I finish, I will have to learn the back end side.


Programming really taught me alot of things about life, including **Not giving up in the face of trouble**, and I have acquired
a mindset that I can get anything, it's just that it's still on the way, and ==nothing== really lasts forever, including the sufferings
I am having.

There are a lot more, you could say I am overly dramatic but it is what it is. **This is why I love Programming** of course alongside
many other reasons.


That's it really. Thanks for reading this!
